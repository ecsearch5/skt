{"name":"Skt","tagline":"An implementation of Selective K-means Tree","body":"Selective K-means Tree Search\r\n================================\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nThis project is the source code of the paper \"**Selective K-means Tree Search**\".\r\nIn this project, we achieved to create a library for nearest neighbors search with the following features:\r\n\r\n* An implementation of **Product Quantization for Approximated Nearest Neighbor Search** \r\n* An implementation of **the inverted multi-index**\r\n* An implementation of **re-ranking**\r\n* The method that is described in **Searching for nearest neighbors with a dense space partitioning** and **Selective K-means Tree Search**.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n#### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* An Unix Operating System. Tested on Mac OS X 10.9 and Ubuntu 14.04.\r\n* [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) 2.8 or newer. For UNIX users, check your CMake version in terminal by `cmake -version`.\r\n* An GNU C++ Compiler or LLVM compiler that support C++ 11 and OpenMP.\r\n* [BOOST](http://www.boost.org) library installed on the machine.\r\n\r\n#### Build\r\n\r\nWe use CMake as the build system. On terminal,\r\n```bash\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:marker68/skt.git\r\n$ cd ./skt\r\n$ git submodule update --init\r\n$ cmake -H. -Bbuild && cmake --build build -- -j4\r\n# OR IF YOU WANT TO BUILD TESTS\r\n$ cmake -DBUILD_TEST=ON -H. -Bbuild && cmake --build build -- -j4\r\n```\r\nThis script will create binaries in your `bin/` and `lib/` directories. \r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nWe are using Doxygen to generate the documentation. You can find that the style of comments for every methods that are implemented in these source codes are matching with Doxygen style.\r\nTo generate the documentation:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ cd ./doc\r\n$ doxygen config.doxygen\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoxygen will create the documentation files in HTML and LaTeX format. You can also find samples and documentation in the Wiki of this project.\r\n\r\n## To developers\r\n\r\n* This project was built under Eclipse CDT so we leave the configuration files `.cproject` and `.project` of the project here. If you are using Eclipse, just import the folder that contains the source code.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
